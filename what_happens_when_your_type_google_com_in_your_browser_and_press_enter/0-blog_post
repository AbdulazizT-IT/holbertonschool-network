What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter
This article explains the complete journey of your request — from your browser to Google’s servers — touching on key technologies that make the modern web work.
1. DNS Request: Translating Domain to IP
When you type https://www.google.com and hit Enter, the browser first needs to convert that domain name into an IP address — because the internet works using IP addresses.
To do this, your device performs a DNS (Domain Name System) lookup. Here's how:
The browser checks its internal cache.
If not found, it asks the OS, which may check its own cache.
If still not found, the OS queries a DNS resolver (usually from your ISP).
The resolver checks root DNS servers, TLD servers (for .com), and then the authoritative DNS server for google.com.
It finally gets back an IP address like 142.250.190.36.
2. Establishing a TCP/IP Connection
Once the IP address is known, your device uses the TCP/IP stack to initiate a connection to Google's server.
The browser initiates a TCP 3-way handshake:
Sends a SYN (synchronize) packet.
Receives a SYN-ACK from Google’s server.
Sends an ACK (acknowledge) to complete the handshake.
This happens over port 443, because it's an HTTPS connection.
3. Firewall: Checking Traffic Rules
As the connection is being made, it passes through one or more firewalls:
Your operating system might have a local firewall (e.g., Windows Defender).
Your router or network may have a firewall.
Google’s data center also uses firewalls.
Each firewall checks whether to allow or block the traffic based on security rules.
4. HTTPS / SSL / TLS: Secure Communication
Since the URL starts with https://, your browser establishes a secure connection using TLS (SSL is the older term).
This includes:
Exchanging SSL certificates.
Verifying the server is really Google (checking certificate authenticity).
Generating a shared encryption key using asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA or ECDSA).
Switching to symmetric encryption (faster) for the rest of the session.
Now, all data exchanged is encrypted — keeping your connection private and secure.
5. Load Balancer: Distributing the Traffic
Once the connection reaches Google’s infrastructure, it goes through a load balancer.
Why?
Google runs thousands of servers.
The load balancer decides which server is available and closest to you.
It forwards your request to the best one for optimal performance.
6. Web Server: Handling the Request
The request arrives at a web server — software like Google's custom HTTP server.
This server:
Parses the HTTP GET request from your browser.
Checks if the request is valid and routes it to the correct part of the backend.
7. Application Server: Generating the Response
Next, the web server might forward the request to an application server.
This server:
Runs backend code (e.g., search algorithms, AI ranking, etc.).
Validates your query.
Communicates with databases or other services as needed.
8. Database: Accessing the Data
If your request involves data — for example, searching for "OpenAI" — the application server queries a database.
Google’s databases are massive and distributed globally.
They return the most relevant results based on your query.
9. Sending the Response Back
Once the application server gets the results:
It sends a response (usually in HTML, maybe with JavaScript, CSS, or JSON) to the web server.
The web server sends it back to your browser over the secure TCP connection.
10. Rendering the Page
Your browser receives the HTML and:
Parses the DOM.
Loads external resources (images, scripts, styles).
Executes JavaScript.
Finally, renders the visible Google Search page.
✅ Conclusion
What seems like a simple action — typing a URL and hitting Enter — actually involves:
DNS resolution
Secure encrypted communication
Complex backend systems
Load balancing
Application logic
Database queries
All of this happens in milliseconds.
Understanding these steps gives you insight into how the internet works — and what powers the seamless user experience we often take for granted.
